\section*{Getting Around Vancouver:}

A lot of Vancouver is very walkable, and the buses and the skytrain are easy to use. \href{https://bit.ly/2DsKc3N}{Google Maps} and \href{http://www.translink.ca}{TransLink} provide accurate information for Vancouver transit.  A trip within Zone 1 costs \$2.75 and will allow you to take as many transfers as needed for 90 minutes. All the transportation fares can be loaded into a Compass card, or directly deduced from your credit card. It's highly recommended to buy a Compass card, which is sold at vending machines at all SkyTrain stations (including at YVR airport), as well as many supermarkets and shops.

In what follows, you will find directions to the hotels and the conference venue, as well as the banquet at 19:00 on Friday at \href{http://www.alporto.ca}{Al Porto Ristorante} in \href{https://tinyurl.com/yasn4eqo}{321 Water Street}. There are also suggestions for places to eat, and some other popular activities in Vancouver.

\section*{Getting to the venue and the hotels from the YVR airport:}

The \href{http://www.translink.ca/en/Schedules-and-Maps/SkyTrain/SkyTrain-Schedules/Canada-Line.aspx}{SkyTrain Canada Line} is the best option for getting from \href{http://www.yvr.ca/en/passengers}{Vancouver International Airport} (YVR) to downtown Vancouver and is faster than taking a taxi. At YVR, follow signs for the SkyTrain and buy your Compass Card at one of the vending machines on the platform.

The conference venue, \href{https://www.sfu.ca/mecs/facilities/harbour-centre.html}{SFU Harbour Centre} (which is right under that landmark tower with the saucer on top), and the \href{http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/yvrdv-delta-vancouver-suites/}{Delta hotel} are steps away from the \href{http://infomaps.translink.ca/System_Maps/skytrain_station_maps/waterfront_station.pdf}{Waterfront station}, while the \href{https://www.sandmanhotels.com/locations/british-columbia/vancouver/hotels/vancouver-city-centre-vcc?property=VCC&adults=2&children=0&dates=2017-01-24_2017-01-29&groupCode=912299&fromSearch=1&currency=CAD}{Sandman hotel} is 5-7 min walk away from the \href{http://infomaps.translink.ca/System_Maps/skytrain_station_maps/granville_vancouver_city_centre_station.pdf}{Vancouver City Centre station}.

The registration desk at Harbour Centre will be open on Wednesday and Thursday until 19:00. On other days it will remain open until the end of the talks. If your flight lands sufficiently early, we suggest that you come straight to the venue, register, and let our volunteers help you find your way to your hotel. 

\subsection*{Delta Hotel:}

\href{http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/yvrdv-delta-vancouver-suites/}{Delta Hotel} is right across the street from SFU Harbour Building. From the airport, take the SkyTrain all the way to Waterfront station. When you get off the train, take the exit to Granville Street. When you are above ground, turn around and go right on West Hastings Street. Delta Vancouver Suites is just over one block away past the Seymour and West Hastings intersection. The entire trip from YVR should take less than 30 minutes, and the SkyTrain comes about every 6 minutes.

\subsection*{Sandman Hotel Vancouver:}
 
\href{https://www.sandmanhotels.com/locations/british-columbia/vancouver/hotels/vancouver-city-centre-vcc?property=VCC&adults=2&children=0&dates=2017-01-24_2017-01-29&groupCode=912299&fromSearch=1&currency=CAD}{Sandman Hotel} is a 5-7 min walk away from the Vancouver City Centre Station on the SkyTrain line coming from the airport. Once you come out of the station, walk along West Georgia Street toward Granville Street. 

Sandman Hotel is also right across the street from the \href{http://infomaps.translink.ca/System_Maps/skytrain_station_maps/stadium_chinatown_station.pdf}{Stadium-Chinatown} SkyTrain station, which is on a different line that also goes to the Waterfront station (i.e. the venue). To get to/from the venue, you can walk for about 15 minutes, or take the SkyTrain from the Stadium Station.

To walk from Sandman to SFU Harbour Centre, go left onto West Georgia Street. Then turn right into Cambie Street. and then take a left at West Hastings Street. Harbour Centre will be right there.


\section*{Getting to the Banquet:}

To get to the banquet at \href{http://www.alporto.ca}{Al Porto Ristorante}, you can either take a bus, walk, or take a taxi. We recommend to go directly from the venue, where our volunteers will be leading groups going there by a 5 minute walk. If you are taking a bus, make sure you have a Compass card or a credit card. You can buy a Compass card in advance from the vending machines at all SkyTrain stations (including at YVR airport). 
\subsection*{Walk from Delta Hotels and Harbour Centre:}

Walk along West Hastings Street towards Richards Street, then turn left on Richards Street. Head straight for 100 meters until Water Street. Al Porto Ristorante is a block away from this intersection.

\subsection*{Walk from Sandman Hotel:}

Walk along Cambie Street towards West Georgia Street. The intersection of Cambie with Water Street is 700 meters away. Turn right at this intersection, Al Porto Ristorante is on the right.

\section*{Places to Eat:}

Vancouver is an awesome city for eating out, especially for Asian food of all types, but also other types of international cuisine and fusion. For \textbf{lunch}, the easiest option is to go to the big food court underneath the venue, which offers a good variety of healthy and other types of fast food. There are also many restaurants nearby. The list below is a short-list of some of the organizersâ€™ favourites.
